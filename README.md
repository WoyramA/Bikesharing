# Bikesharing

## Overview
The Bikesharing project is a data visualization project proposed by Woyram, which she plans to pull off with the help of a visualization expert and consultant, Kate. In this project Woyram uses the Tableau dashboard to explain her idea to investors who are interested in the bike-sharing-company she is proposing in Des- Moines.
